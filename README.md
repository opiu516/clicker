# clicker

Clicker is a mobile game created and exported trough the cordova framework. The goal of the game is to follow your number 1 -> 2 -> 3 and not click on the decoys or let your time run out
it won't work well in browser because it's purely created for mobile. The game is ready to add sound and music but i hadn't desidet what to put on there. It has fully random daily
challenges with different dificulties and purposes. The apk is added so you can try playing it yourself!
